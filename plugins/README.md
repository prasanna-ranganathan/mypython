# Dataloop Plugins

Plugins written in Python that output Nagios standard exit codes and performance data for use in Dataloop.

To use these plugins simply copy and paste the raw script into a new Plugin.

Over time some plugins may mature and get moved into packs alongside dashboards and alert rules.
